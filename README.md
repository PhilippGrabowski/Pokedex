# Pokedex
That's my first API Project. This project represents the original Pokedex where you can find all informations about the pokemon.
You can search for pokemon names, id's and types. By clicking on a pokemon card, you can see the details including stats, evolutions and moves.
Also you can catch and add a pokemon to your favorite list by clicking on the star.
